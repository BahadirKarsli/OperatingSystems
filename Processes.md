### Core Concepts and Operating System Services

- **Operating System Services** provide interfaces that enable programs to interact with hardware and system resources. These services are typically accessed via system calls, which are the fundamental mechanism for user programs to request OS functions.
- **API, System Calls, and OS Relationship:** System calls serve as the bridge between user applications and OS functionalities, exposing controlled access to hardware and kernel services.

### System Call Parameter Passing Methods

| Method                         | Description                                                        | Advantages                          | Disadvantages                    |
|-------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------|---------------------------------|
| Registers                     | Parameters passed directly in CPU registers                        | Simplest, no memory copy overhead | Limited by number of registers  |
| Block/Table in Memory          | A register holds the address of a memory block containing parameters | Can handle large number or length of parameters | Involves memory access          |
| Stack                         | Parameters pushed onto stack by program and popped by OS          | Unlimited parameters length/number | Memory overhead                 |

- Linux and Solaris use block/table-in-memory method.
- Stack and block methods handle arbitrarily large parameters but cost memory usage.

### Kernel Architectures

| Kernel Type       | Description                                   | Reliability                                   | Development Ease                     | Speed & Memory Usage                   |
|-------------------|-----------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------|------------------------------------|--------------------------------------|
| Monolithic Kernel | Entire OS runs in kernel space                 | Single driver failure crashes entire kernel  | Difficult, entire kernel must work  | Fast, no extra context switching     |
| Microkernel       | Minimal kernel running core services          | Kernel can restart crashed subsystem          | Easier to test and develop modules  | Slower due to message passing         |
| Hybrid Kernel     | Combination of both                            | Balances reliability and speed                | Modern OSes (Windows, macOS) use it | Moderate performance and memory usage |

- Linux is closer to monolithic; Windows and macOS adopt hybrid kernels with loadable kernel modules such as Linux kernel modules (LKMs), Windows device drivers, and macOS extensions.

### Process Management

#### Process Concept and Representation

- **Process:** A program in execution, which is an active entity as opposed to a passive program stored on disk.
- **Components of a Process:**
  - **Text section:** Program code
  - **Program counter:** Current instruction address
  - **Stack:** Temporary data (function parameters, return addresses, local variables)
  - **Data section:** Global variables
  - **Heap:** Dynamically allocated memory during runtime
- Multiple processes can execute the same program concurrently.

#### Memory Layout Example (C Program)

| Segment               | Size (bytes) | Description                         |
|-----------------------|--------------|-----------------------------------|
| Text                  | 1603         | Program code                      |
| Data                  | 600          | Initialized global/static data    |
| BSS                   | 8            | Uninitialized data                |
| Total (dec/hex)        | 2211 / 0x8a3 | Sum of all segments               |

- Example shows memory addresses for various data types (global, stack, heap, constants) and allocation sizes for dynamic memory in a running C program.

### Process Control and States

- **Process States:**
  - New: Creation in progress
  - Running: Executing instructions
  - Waiting: Awaiting an event (e.g., I/O)
  - Ready: Waiting to be assigned CPU
  - Terminated: Execution complete

- **Process Control Block (PCB):** Kernel data structure storing process state, program counter, CPU registers, scheduling info, memory management info, accounting data, and I/O status.

---

### Threads

- A **thread** is a single sequence of execution within a process.
- Threads allow multiple program counters per process, enabling concurrency.
- PCB must store multiple program counters and thread-specific data.

---

### Linux Process Representation

- Process represented by `struct task_struct` containing:
  - Process state, scheduling priority, CPU usage
  - Parent, children, and sibling process links
  - Memory management info (`mm_struct`)
  - Thread information (`thread_info`)

- Linux supports process iteration using macros like `for_each_process`.

---

### Process Scheduling

- Scheduler selects the next process to execute, aiming to:
  - Maximize CPU utilization
  - Enable rapid context switching to provide responsive user interaction

- Maintains multiple queues:
  - **Ready queue:** Processes ready to run
  - **Wait queues:** Processes waiting for events (e.g., I/O)

- **Context Switch:** Saving old process state and loading new process state; overhead depends on PCB size and hardware support.

---

### Process Management in Mobile Systems

- **iOS:** Single foreground process; background processes suspended with strict limitations.
- **Android:** Supports foreground, visible, service, background, and cached processes with a priority-based process management system that kills least important processes first when resources are low.

| Android Process Type | Description                                                                                 |
|---------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Foreground          | Active user-interacting process (Activity, BroadcastReceiver, or Service running)           |
| Visible             | Visible but not foreground; service running in foreground or user-aware background feature  |
| Service             | Running background service important to user (e.g., network tasks)                          |
| Cached              | Idle process, eligible for termination when memory is scarce                               |

---

### Process Creation and Termination

- **Creation:**
  - Parent process creates child processes forming a process tree.
  - Identified via Process IDs (PIDs).
  - Resource sharing can vary: full sharing, partial, or none.
  - Execution can be concurrent or synchronous (parent waits for child).
  - UNIX uses `fork()`, `exec()`, and `wait()` system calls.
  - Windows uses `CreateProcess()` and `WaitForSingleObject()` APIs.

- **Termination:**
  - Process calls `exit()` to finish and release resources.
  - Parent can terminate children using `kill()`.
  - Some OS enforce cascading termination (children terminate if parent does).
  - Parent waits for child's termination via `wait()`; uncollected terminated processes become zombies; orphaned processes are adopted by init or system process.

---

### Interprocess Communication (IPC)

- **Purpose:** Facilitate communication and cooperation between independent or cooperating processes.
- **Reasons for IPC:**
  - Information sharing
  - Computation speedup
  - Modularity
  - Convenience

#### IPC Models

| IPC Model       | Characteristics                                             | Pros                            | Cons                              |
|-----------------|-------------------------------------------------------------|--------------------------------|----------------------------------|
| Message Passing | Processes exchange discrete messages                         | Secure, flexible, error handling| Latency, overhead, complexity    |
| Shared Memory   | Processes share a region of memory for direct communication  | Fast, efficient for large data | Requires synchronization, security|

- Synchronization mechanisms are essential to avoid race conditions.

#### Producer-Consumer Problem

- Classic IPC example demonstrating synchronization issues.
- Variants:
  - Unbounded buffer: producer never waits, consumer waits if empty.
  - Bounded buffer: fixed buffer size; producer waits if full, consumer waits if empty.
- Busy waiting solutions exist but are inefficient and prone to race conditions in multi-producer/consumer scenarios.

---

### Race Condition Example

- Occurs when multiple processes read/write shared data without proper synchronization.
- Example shows interleaved increments and decrements of a shared counter leading to inconsistent values.
- Synchronization primitives are needed to avoid such conditions.

---

### Message Passing IPC Details

- Operations: `send(destination, &message)` and `receive(source, &message)`.
- Communication links can be direct or indirect (via mailboxes/ports).
- Links may be synchronous (blocking) or asynchronous (non-blocking).
- Buffering strategies:
  - Zero capacity (rendezvous): sender waits for receiver.
  - Bounded capacity: finite message queue.
  - Unbounded capacity: infinite queue, sender never waits.

### Examples of IPC Systems

| System       | IPC Mechanism                     | Features                                                       |
|--------------|---------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------|
| POSIX        | Shared memory, semaphores        | `shm_open()`, `mmap()`, `shm_unlink()` for shared memory management |
| Mach         | Message-based communication      | Uses ports, `mach_msg()` for send/receive, supports flexible blocking and timeouts |
| Windows      | Local Procedure Calls (LPC)      | Port-based communication channels, client-server model          |
| Pipes        | Unidirectional or bidirectional | Ordinary pipes (parent-child), named pipes (any processes)      |
| Sockets      | Network communication endpoints  | TCP, UDP, and multicast support for communication over network  |
| Remote Procedure Calls (RPC) | Abstracted procedure calls over network | Uses stubs, marshalling/unmarshalling, supports client-server interaction |

---

### Client-Server Communication

- **Sockets:** Endpoint pairs identified by IP address and port number.
- **RPC:** Abstracts remote service calls as local procedure calls.
  - Steps include marshalling parameters, sending message, unmarshalling, and executing procedure on server.
  - Uses external data representation (XDR) to handle architecture differences.
  - OS provides rendezvous services for connecting clients and servers.
